# Gait-analysis-of-SCI-patients
# INTRODUCTION
------------

The goal of this project in the context of the course BIOENG-404 is to develop a deeper knowledge 
of locomotion and to develop the ability to implement analytic methods to experimental datasets in 
order to characterize and compare different gait patterns in healthy individuals and in people with 
spinal cord injury. The datasets provided during the course contain kinematic and Electromyography (EMG)
data. Some parameters were extracted to perform a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to analyze the key
differences between the different conditions.
